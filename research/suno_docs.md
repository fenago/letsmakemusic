## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Generate Your First Song

Start with a simple music generation request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl -X POST "https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "prompt": "A peaceful acoustic guitar melody with soft vocals, folk style",
      "customMode": false,
      "instrumental": false,
      "model": "V3_5",
      "callBackUrl": "https://your-server.com/callback"
    }'
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const response = await fetch('https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt: 'A peaceful acoustic guitar melody with soft vocals, folk style',
      customMode: false,
      instrumental: false,
      model: 'V3_5',
      callBackUrl: 'https://your-server.com/callback'
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Task ID:', data.data.taskId);
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = "https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }

  payload = {
      "prompt": "A peaceful acoustic guitar melody with soft vocals, folk style",
      "customMode": False,
      "instrumental": False,
      "model": "V3_5",
      "callBackUrl": "https://your-server.com/callback"
  }

  response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
  result = response.json()

  print(f"Task ID: {result['data']['taskId']}")
  ```

  ```php PHP theme={null}
  <?php
  $url = 'https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate';
  $headers = [
      'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type: application/json'
  ];

  $payload = [
      'prompt' => 'A peaceful acoustic guitar melody with soft vocals, folk style',
      'customMode' => false,
      'instrumental' => false,
      'model' => 'V3_5',
      'callBackUrl' => 'https://your-server.com/callback'
  ];

  $ch = curl_init();
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

  $response = curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);

  $result = json_decode($response, true);
  echo "Task ID: " . $result['data']['taskId'];
  ?>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Check Task Status

Use the returned task ID to check generation status:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl -X GET "https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate/record-info?taskId=YOUR_TASK_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate/record-info?taskId=${taskId}`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });

  const result = await response.json();

  if (result.data.status === 'SUCCESS') {
    console.log('Generation complete!');
    console.log('Audio URLs:', result.data.response.data);
  } else if (result.data.status === 'GENERATING') {
    console.log('Still generating...');
  } else {
    console.log('Generation failed:', result.data.status);
  }
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests
  import time

  def check_task_status(task_id, api_key):
      url = f"https://api.sunoapi.org/api/v1/generate/record-info?taskId={task_id}"
      headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
      
      response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
      result = response.json()
      
      status = result['data']['status']
      
      if status == 'SUCCESS':
          print("Generation complete!")
          audio_data = result['data']['response']['data']
          for i, audio in enumerate(audio_data):
              print(f"Track {i+1}: {audio['audio_url']}")
          return audio_data
      elif status == 'GENERATING':
          print("Still generating...")
          return None
      else:
          print(f"Generation failed: {status}")
          return None

  # Poll until completion
  task_id = "YOUR_TASK_ID"
  while True:
      audio_data = check_task_status(task_id, "YOUR_API_KEY")
      if audio_data:
          break
      time.sleep(30)  # Wait 30 seconds before checking again
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```javascript  theme={null}
const extendTaskId = await api.generateMusic({
  uploadUrl: 'https://example.com/my-song.mp3',
  defaultParamFlag: true,
  prompt: 'Add a rock guitar solo section',
  continueAt: 60,
  model: 'V4_5'
});
```

### Audio Format Conversion

```javascript  theme={null}
const wavTaskId = await api.convertToWav({
  taskId: 'original_task_id',
  audioId: 'e231****-****-****-****-****8cadc7dc',
  callBackUrl: 'https://your-server.com/wav-callback'
});
```

### Music Video Generation

```javascript  theme={null}
const videoTaskId = await api.createMusicVideo({
  taskId: 'music_task_id',
  audioId: 'e231****-****-****-****-****8cadc7dc',
  author: 'Artist Name',
  domainName: 'your-brand.com',
  callBackUrl: 'https://your-server.com/video-callback'
});
```

### Using Callbacks

```javascript  theme={null}
// Your callback endpoint
app.post('/music-callback', (req, res) => {
  const { code, data } = req.body;
  
  if (code === 200) {
    console.log('Music ready:', data.data);
    data.data.forEach(track => {
      console.log(`Title: ${track.title}`);
      console.log(`Audio: ${track.audio_url}`);
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Generation failed:', req.body.msg);
  }
  
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
});
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Optimization">
    * Use detailed, specific descriptions for music style and mood
    * Include instrument specifications and vocal requirements
    * Specify tempo, energy level, and song structure
    * Avoid conflicting or overly complex descriptions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Selection">
    * Use V3\_5 for creative and experimental music
    * Choose V4 for highest audio quality in standard lengths
    * Select V4\_5 for advanced features and longer tracks
    * V4\_5PLUS offers richer sound with new creative ways
    * V5 provides faster generation with superior musicality
    * Consider your specific use case and quality requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    * Use callbacks instead of frequent polling
    * Implement proper retry logic for failed requests
    * Monitor your credit usage and plan accordingly
    * Cache results to avoid regenerating similar content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    * Implement appropriate retry logic for transient failures
    * Monitor task status and handle timeout scenarios
    * Validate input parameters before making requests
    * Log errors for debugging and monitoring
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## File Storage and Access

<Warning>
  Generated audio files are stored for **15 days** before automatic deletion. Download URLs may have limited validity periods.
</Warning>

* Audio files remain accessible for 15 days after generation
* Download and save important files to your own storage
* Use the API to regenerate content if needed after expiration
* Consider implementing local backup strategies for critical content

                ## Usage


                Add to request headers:

                      generated lyrics will match your vision.  

                      - The maximum word limit is 200 words.

                1. Visit the [API Key Management
                Page](https://sunoapi.org/api-key) to obtain your API Key


                ## Usage


                Add to request headers:


                ```

                Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

                ```


                > **⚠️ Note:**

                > - Keep your API Key secure and do not share it with others

                > - If you suspect your API Key has been compromised, reset it

                      The audio ID of the specific track to convert.  

                      - Providing the specific `audioId` ensures the exact track
                      is converted, especially when a task has multiple tracks.
                    example: e231****-****-****-****-****8cadc7dc

                      - Required.  

                      - The callback includes a single download URL for the
                      converted WAV file.


                      For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see
                      [WAV Format Conversion
                      Callbacks](./convert-to-wav-format-callbacks)

                      - Alternatively, you can use the get WAV conversion
                      details endpoint to poll task status
